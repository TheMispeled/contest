This repo has nothing to do with a contest. It is named like it is for conveniency.

# Using spcesim contest edition forever
If you really want to use lastest versions of Spacesim, you'll have to do some changes to the exe file. First, go to line offset 00BDE820 in an hexadecimal editor such as HxD. Then replace the url with https://themispeled.github.io/contest/infos .(from h to s)

Also make sure you set your computer date before the contest ended.

***WARNING : THE CHARACTERS ARE SEPARATED BY A 00 (null) BLOCK, SO MAKE SURE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT! (SPACES AND COMMAS ARE NOT 00 BLOCK)***
